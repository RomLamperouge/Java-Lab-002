# Java-Lab-002

## Variables, Types and Operators

Be able to explain what variables are. Understand variable types, allowed names, and valid values.
Know how to create and use string, integer, floating-point, and boolean variables.

### Part 1 - PricelessScript.java - [MasterCard YouTube Ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_6stXKGuHo)

The lab template contains a program that prints the following:
```
2 tickets: $28.00
2 hotdogs, 2 popcorn, 2 sodas: $18.00
1 autographed baseball $45.00
real conversation with 11 year old son: priceless
true
```

Ignore the code that you don't fully recognize and concentrate on changing the variables to alter the MasterCard *Priceless* script to say:
```
3 tickets: $42.00
3 hotdogs, 3 popcorn, 3 sodas: $27.00
2 autographed baseball $90.00
watching the Giants win: priceless
false
```

### Part 2 - Interpretation
Take note of the various variables and their data types. Write a brief summary in this section of the README.md file listing the:
 
The int variable is interesting to me. The integer variable allowed this assignment to be really easy. The integer variable was a 
simple solution that allowed me to change one number and half the assignment was done. That 3 is linked to the other numbers so it will duplicate 
them to the set amount completing the hotdogs, popcorn, and soda quickly. An example of how this works is if the tickets are 14.00 then two 
are the 28 so a third is the 42 we needed.

Next give TWO example variable names and TWO example variable assignments that are *WRONG* and explain why.
* Hint: your IDE can help you discover these!

One example is if I were to change int value to ticket price because it would switch numbers around.
Another example is if I were to change my double value to ticket value I would drastically hike the consumable prices 
to almost accurate prices.

### Part 3 - Bonus: Play around with Java String Format Specifiers.

Pick several of the Java format specifiers below and define variables of the correct type utilize *sout* and *String.format* to view the resulting formats.

### Part 4 - Submission
* Just as you did last week (Reference the Lab video in your Week 1 module), create a Spring2023 feature branch of your code
* Commit your working code to your local copy
* Push it to your Remote/origin branch (i.e. GitHub: Spring2023 -> origin/Spring2023)
* Then issue a Pull request to my instructor branch
    * Make sure to save the Pull request URL and submit it for the lab.
